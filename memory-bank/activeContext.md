# Active Context: TarotLyfe

## Current Focus
The project has completed both Milestone 1 and Milestone 2 implementation phases. With Milestone 1, we successfully implemented authentication with Supabase, responsive navigation, landing page, and dashboard placeholder. With Milestone 2, we've implemented the complete Tarot Reading Module and AI Interpretation Engine.

We have made significant progress on Milestone 3, having completed Phase 1 (Database Setup), Phase 2 (Service Layer), Phase 3 (Journal Entry Core), Phase 4 (Journal Management), Phase 5 (Dashboard Integration), and Phase 6 (Reading-Journal Connection). We've created the database schema for journals, journal tags, and tag mappings with appropriate Row-Level Security policies, extended the Supabase service layer with comprehensive journal and tag management functions, implemented the Redux state management for the journaling feature, added rich text editing, enhanced mood selection, advanced filtering and search for journal entries, implemented an enhanced dashboard with journal integration, activity statistics, and quick action buttons, and completed the reading-journal connection flow with visual indicators and rich previews.

We are now working on Phase 7 (Testing & Refinement) of Milestone 3. We've set up Cypress for end-to-end testing and implemented a comprehensive test suite covering all aspects of the journaling feature, including core functionality, filtering and search, reading-journal connections, dashboard integration, and authentication. We've also enhanced our testing approach by adding a custom getByData command to improve selector consistency and maintainability. Additionally, we've updated our React components with consistent data-test attributes that match our test selectors.

## Learnings & Project Insights
New insights from Milestone 3 Phase 7 (Testing & Refinement):
- Standardized selector patterns with custom commands greatly improve test maintenance
- Consistent data-test attributes make tests more resilient to UI structure changes
- Using test-focused attributes rather than relying on UI classes decouples testing from styling
- Organizing test files by feature helps maintain focus and allows targeted test runs
- Adding proper data selectors to components during development is more efficient than adding them later

Previous insights from Milestone 3 Phase 7 (Testing & Refinement):
- End-to-end testing with Cypress provides important validation of user flows
- Custom commands significantly improve test readability and maintenance
- Testing reveals edge cases that might be missed during development
- Having separate test suites for different features allows focused and efficient testing
- Fixture files help maintain consistent test data across test suites
- Proper test cleanup is essential for reliable test runs

Previous insights from Milestone 3 Phase 6 (Reading-Journal Connection):
- Creating bidirectional navigation between related features enhances user experience
- Visual indicators for linked content help users understand relationships between data
- URL parameter passing provides a clean way to maintain context between pages
- Proper implementation of optional relationships in database schema is crucial

Previous insights from Milestone 3 Phase 4 (Journal Management):
- Advanced filtering requires careful database query design for performance
- Multi-parameter search with proper UI feedback improves user experience
- Clear visual indicators for active filters help users understand current view state
- Consistent sorting options across different views maintains predictable behavior

Previous insights from Milestone 3 Phase 3 (Journal Entry Core):
- Rich text editing provides a better journaling experience compared to plain text
- Visual mood selectors with emojis create a more intuitive and engaging user experience

- Designing database tables with appropriate foreign key relationships ensures data integrity
- Implementing Row-Level Security at the database level is essential for multi-user applications
- Using complex query filters in Supabase requires proper indexing for performance
- Handling nested relationships (like journal entries -> tags) requires careful state management

The project now has a solid foundation with authentication, the core tarot reading functionality, and a comprehensive journaling feature. We are currently focusing on thorough testing and refinement to ensure all components work well together and provide a smooth user experience.

This active context document will be regularly updated as the project evolves, with particular attention to current focus, recent changes, and next steps to ensure continuity between development sessions.
