# Active Context: TarotLyfe

## Current Focus
The project has completed the Milestone 1 implementation phase. We have successfully implemented the authentication with Supabase, responsive navigation, landing page, and dashboard placeholder. The current focus is now shifting to preparing for Milestone 2, which involves implementing the Tarot Reading Module and AI Interpretation Engine.

## Recent Changes
- Completed Milestone 1 implementation:
  - Integrated Supabase for authentication (replacing Clerk that was initially in package.json)
  - Created authentication components (login, signup, password reset, confirmation)
  - Implemented protected routes for authenticated users
  - Developed responsive navigation and footer components
  - Created landing page with hero section, feature highlights, and pricing section
  - Built dashboard placeholder page for authenticated users
  - Set up environment variables for Supabase configuration

## Next Steps
1. **Milestone 2 Implementation Planning**
   - Design tarot card components and visual representation
   - Plan card shuffle animations and interactions
   - Research AI integration options for tarot interpretations
   - Design spread selection interface

2. **Technical Improvements**
   - Refactor SCSS to address deprecation warnings
   - Update imports to use modern @use and @forward syntax
   - Replace deprecated color functions with modern alternatives

3. **Feature Development**
   - Begin implementing tarot card components
   - Create card deck and shuffle functionality
   - Develop spread selection interface
   - Research and implement AI integration for tarot readings

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Supabase for authentication and database instead of Clerk
- Feature-based code organization maintains clear separation of concerns
- Redux Toolkit async thunks for authentication actions
- Protected routes implementation with loading states
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

### Implementation Priorities
- Tarot reading implementation (Milestone 2)
- Refactoring SCSS to address deprecation warnings
- Enhancing user experience with animations
- Ensuring proper loading states and error handling
- Improving visual design with tarot-themed elements

### Pending Decisions
- Specific AI API provider for tarot card interpretations
- Deployment platform selection
- Visual design for tarot cards (custom illustrations vs. traditional)
- Database schema for storing reading history
- Integration approach for journaling features in Milestone 3

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Project Patterns
- Early returns for error handling in React components
- Feature-focused organization of code
- Component-based architecture with clear hierarchy
- Redux state slices per feature
- Custom hooks for reusable logic (auth state, form handling)

### Coding Preferences
- PascalCase for React components
- camelCase for variables and functions
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Event handler functions prefixed with "handle"
- Organize components by feature in dedicated directories

### UI/UX Considerations
- Intuitive, engaging, and accessible interface
- Thoughtful and reflective design that encourages mindfulness
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Seamless integration between tarot readings and journaling
- Privacy-focused design with secure user data handling
- Consistent use of dark themes with gradient accents across sections
- Card-based UI components with hover effects and visual hierarchy

## Learnings & Project Insights
Insights from Milestone 1 implementation include:

- The Supabase authentication integration provides a robust foundation for the application
- Feature-based organization makes it easier to locate and update related code
- Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk simplifies handling async operations like authentication
- Protected routes with proper loading states improve user experience
- Responsive design from the start ensures consistent experience across devices
- Clear component hierarchy improves maintainability and understanding
- SCSS deprecation warnings need to be addressed for future-proofing

The project now has a solid foundation with authentication, navigation, and structure in place. This provides a good starting point for implementing the core tarot and journaling functionality in upcoming milestones. The component architecture is flexible enough to accommodate the upcoming features without major refactoring.

This active context document will be regularly updated as the project evolves, with particular attention to current focus, recent changes, and next steps to ensure continuity between development sessions.
