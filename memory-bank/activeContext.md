# Active Context: TarotLyfe

## Current Focus
The project is currently in the initialization phase. We're establishing the memory bank documentation and preparing for development. The immediate focus is on setting up the project structure, defining development standards, and preparing for implementation of the core features.

## Recent Changes
- Created initial memory bank files:
  - projectbrief.md (already existed)
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md (this file)
  - progress.md (to be created next)

## Next Steps
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize the React project with the proper folder structure
   - Set up essential dependencies and configuration
   - Establish development environment with proper tooling

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Focus on Milestone 1: Landing Page, Authentication, and Core Navigation
   - Implement basic UI components following design patterns outlined in systemPatterns.md
   - Set up authentication integration with Clerk

3. **Documentation Expansion**
   - Expand memory bank as needed when implementation decisions are made
   - Keep activeContext.md and progress.md updated to reflect current status

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Using React with Redux Toolkit for frontend state management
- JavaScript (not TypeScript) as specified in coding guidelines
- Feature-based code organization to maintain clear separation of concerns
- SCSS for styling with consistent patterns
- Node.js backend with PostgreSQL database

### Implementation Priorities
- Focus on establishing a solid foundation before adding features
- Landing page and authentication first, then core user flows
- Ensure responsive design from the beginning (mobile-first approach)
- Implement proper error handling early with standardized patterns

### Pending Decisions
- Specific AI API provider for tarot card interpretations
- Deployment platform selection
- Testing strategy implementation details
- Authentication flow specifics using Clerk

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Project Patterns
- Early returns for error handling
- Feature-focused organization of code
- Component-based architecture with clear hierarchy
- Consistent naming conventions as specified in techContext.md
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### Coding Preferences
- PascalCase for React components
- camelCase for variables and functions
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Event handler functions prefixed with "handle"
- Organize components by feature in dedicated directories

### UI/UX Considerations
- Intuitive, engaging, and accessible interface
- Thoughtful and reflective design that encourages mindfulness
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Seamless integration between tarot readings and journaling
- Privacy-focused design with secure user data handling

## Learnings & Project Insights
As the project is in its initialization phase, specific learnings will be documented as development progresses. Initial insights from planning include:

- The importance of a clear architecture before implementation begins
- The need for consistent patterns across the application
- The benefit of organizing by feature for better maintainability
- The critical nature of user experience in a reflective, personal application like TarotLyfe

This active context document will be regularly updated as the project evolves, with particular attention to current focus, recent changes, and next steps to ensure continuity between development sessions.
