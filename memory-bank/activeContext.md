# Active Context: TarotLyfe

## Current Focus
The project has completed both Milestone 1 and Milestone 2 implementation phases. With Milestone 1, we successfully implemented authentication with Supabase, responsive navigation, landing page, and dashboard placeholder. With Milestone 2, we've implemented the complete Tarot Reading Module and AI Interpretation Engine. 

We have now completed planning for Milestone 3 and are ready to begin implementation. This milestone will add the journaling feature and enhance the user dashboard with integration between tarot readings and journal entries. A comprehensive implementation plan has been created in `memory-bank/milestone3-plan.md`.

## Recent Changes
- Completed Milestone 2 implementation (ALL phases):
  - Created comprehensive tarot card data structure with all 78 cards (tarotData.js)
  - Built TarotDeck component for managing and interacting with cards
  - Implemented SpreadSelector with multiple spread layouts (Single Card, Three-Card, Celtic Cross, etc.)
  - Developed ShuffleAnimation component for interactive card shuffling
  - Created UserIntent component for capturing reading questions
  - Built ReadingInterpretation component for displaying results
  - Implemented Redux state management for tarot reading flow
  - Connected tarot reading feature with navigation and dashboard
  - Integrated responsive design across all tarot components
  
  - AI Integration (Phase 3):
    - Created interpretationService with sophisticated prompt engineering
    - Implemented request caching to improve performance
    - Built theme and tone detection for context-aware readings
    - Designed structured response format for consistent interpretations
    
  - Database Integration (Phase 5):
    - Created database tables for readings with Row-Level Security
    - Extended supabaseService with reading management functions
    - Connected Redux to database operations for reading persistence
    - Added proper error handling for database operations
    
  - Testing & Refinement (Phase 6):  
    - Implemented ReadingHistory component with filtering and pagination
    - Created RecentReadingsWidget for dashboard integration
    - Added routes for reading history and individual reading views
    - Connected all components with comprehensive state management

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Milestone 3 according to plan**
   - **Phase 1**: Create database schema for journals, tags, and mapping tables
   - **Phase 2**: Extend supabaseService.js with journal-related functions
   - **Phase 3**: Implement journal entry form with rich text editing
   - **Phase 4**: Create journal management with filtering and search
   - **Phase 5**: Enhance dashboard with journal widgets
   - **Phase 6**: Establish reading-journal connection
   - **Phase 7**: Test and refine all components

2. **Enhance AI Interpretation for Production**
   - Research and select AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, etc.)
   - Implement secure API keys management
   - Fine-tune prompts for more accurate tarot interpretations

3. **Technical Improvements**
   - Refactor SCSS to address deprecation warnings
   - Update imports to use modern @use and @forward syntax
   - Replace deprecated color functions with modern alternatives
   - Add testing for tarot reading components

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Supabase for authentication and database instead of Clerk
- Feature-based code organization maintains clear separation of concerns
- Redux Toolkit async thunks for authentication actions
- Protected routes implementation with loading states
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

### Implementation Priorities
- Journaling feature implementation (Milestone 3)
- AI interpretation service enhancement with real API integration
- Refactoring SCSS to address deprecation warnings
- Testing components for reliability and performance
- Improving integration between tarot readings and user dashboard

### Pending Decisions
- Selection of specific AI API provider for production (options include OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Hugging Face models)
- Implementation approach for AI integration (direct API, backend proxy, or Supabase Edge Functions)
- Selection of rich text editor library for journal entries (options include Quill, Draft.js, TipTap)
- Design of dashboard statistics and activity visualizations
- Mobile layout optimizations for the journal interface

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Project Patterns
- Early returns for error handling in React components
- Feature-focused organization of code
- Component-based architecture with clear hierarchy
- Redux state slices per feature
- Custom hooks for reusable logic (auth state, form handling)

### Coding Preferences
- PascalCase for React components
- camelCase for variables and functions
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Event handler functions prefixed with "handle"
- Organize components by feature in dedicated directories

### UI/UX Considerations
- Intuitive, engaging, and accessible interface
- Thoughtful and reflective design that encourages mindfulness
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Seamless integration between tarot readings and journaling
- Privacy-focused design with secure user data handling
- Consistent use of dark themes with gradient accents across sections
- Card-based UI components with hover effects and visual hierarchy

## Learnings & Project Insights
Insights from Milestone 1 and 2 implementations include:

- The Supabase authentication integration provides a robust foundation for the application
- Feature-based organization makes it easier to locate and update related code
- Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk simplifies handling async operations like authentication
- Protected routes with proper loading states improve user experience
- Responsive design from the start ensures consistent experience across devices
- Clear component hierarchy improves maintainability and understanding
- SCSS deprecation warnings need to be addressed for future-proofing

New insights from Milestone 2:
- Breaking down complex workflows into discrete steps improves user experience
- React's component model works well for card-based interfaces with reusable elements
- Redux state management is valuable for multi-step processes like tarot readings
- Animation can significantly enhance the mystical experience of tarot card interaction
- Tailwind CSS utility classes speed up consistent UI development across components

Additional insights from completing all phases:
- Proper database schema design with Row-Level Security is crucial for user data privacy
- Caching strategies can significantly improve performance for API-dependent features
- Context-aware AI responses provide more meaningful and personalized experiences
- Breaking reading history into filterable, paginated views improves usability as data grows
- Component reuse between main features and dashboard widgets creates consistency
- Structured JSON responses from interpretation services allow for flexible UI rendering

The project now has both a solid foundation with authentication and the core tarot reading functionality implemented. This puts us in a strong position to implement the journaling features and enhance the overall application in Milestone 3.

This active context document will be regularly updated as the project evolves, with particular attention to current focus, recent changes, and next steps to ensure continuity between development sessions.
