# Active Context: TarotLyfe

## Current Focus
The project has completed the initialization phase and is now ready to begin Milestone 1 feature implementation. The basic project structure, state management, routing, and styling foundation have been established. The current focus is on implementing the core features of Milestone 1: Landing Page, Authentication with Supabase, and Core Navigation. A detailed implementation plan for Milestone 1 has been created and documented in `memory-bank/milestone1-plan.md`.

## Recent Changes
- Completed project setup:
  - Initialized React project with Vite
  - Set up folder structure following feature-based organization
  - Configured Redux Toolkit for state management
  - Implemented routing with React Router
  - Created SCSS styling architecture with variables and components
  - Set up environment variables and ESLint for code quality
  - Added basic layouts and components for development
  - Created an authentication state slice

## Next Steps
1. **Milestone 1 Implementation**
   - Develop landing page with CTA (Call to Action)
   - Implement authentication integration with Supabase
   - Create Supabase database with proper Row Level Security
   - Create core navigation and protected routes
   - Build dashboard page scaffolding

2. **Technical Improvements**
   - Refactor SCSS to address deprecation warnings
   - Update imports to use modern @use and @forward syntax
   - Replace deprecated color functions with modern alternatives

3. **Feature Development**
   - Begin implementing shared UI components for consistent design
   - Set up integration with backend for authentication
   - Create tarot card components for the reading feature

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Using React with Redux Toolkit for frontend state management
- JavaScript (not TypeScript) as specified in coding guidelines
- Feature-based code organization to maintain clear separation of concerns
- SCSS for styling with consistent patterns
- Node.js backend with PostgreSQL database

### Implementation Priorities
- Landing page and authentication implementation (Milestone 1)
- Building a robust component library for UI consistency
- Ensuring responsive design works across all devices
- Implementing proper error handling in authentication flows
- Setting up a seamless user experience between pages

### Pending Decisions
- Specific AI API provider for tarot card interpretations
- Deployment platform selection
- Testing strategy implementation details
- Authentication flow implementation details with Supabase
- Initial landing page messaging and visual design approach

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Project Patterns
- Early returns for error handling
- Feature-focused organization of code
- Component-based architecture with clear hierarchy
- Consistent naming conventions as specified in techContext.md
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### Coding Preferences
- PascalCase for React components
- camelCase for variables and functions
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Event handler functions prefixed with "handle"
- Organize components by feature in dedicated directories

### UI/UX Considerations
- Intuitive, engaging, and accessible interface
- Thoughtful and reflective design that encourages mindfulness
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Seamless integration between tarot readings and journaling
- Privacy-focused design with secure user data handling

## Learnings & Project Insights
Initial insights from planning and implementation include:

- The importance of a clear architecture before implementation begins
- The need for consistent patterns across the application
- The benefit of organizing by feature for better maintainability
- The critical nature of user experience in a reflective, personal application like TarotLyfe
- The value of SCSS for creating a maintainable styling system
- The benefit of setting up a proper project structure early on
- The importance of addressing technical debt (SCSS deprecation warnings) early
- The advantages of using Supabase for authentication and database needs, providing built-in security with Row Level Security (RLS) and real-time capabilities

This active context document will be regularly updated as the project evolves, with particular attention to current focus, recent changes, and next steps to ensure continuity between development sessions.
