# Active Context: TarotLyfe

## Current Focus
The project has completed both Milestone 1 and Milestone 2 implementation phases. With Milestone 1, we successfully implemented authentication with Supabase, responsive navigation, landing page, and dashboard placeholder. With Milestone 2, we've implemented the complete Tarot Reading Module and AI Interpretation Engine. The current focus is now planning for Milestone 3, which will add the journaling feature and enhance the user dashboard with integration between tarot readings and journal entries.

## Recent Changes
- Completed Milestone 2 implementation:
  - Created comprehensive tarot card data structure with all 78 cards (tarotData.js)
  - Built TarotDeck component for managing and interacting with cards
  - Implemented SpreadSelector with multiple spread layouts (Single Card, Three-Card, Celtic Cross, etc.)
  - Developed ShuffleAnimation component for interactive card shuffling
  - Created UserIntent component for capturing reading questions
  - Built ReadingInterpretation component for displaying results
  - Implemented Redux state management for tarot reading flow
  - Connected tarot reading feature with navigation and dashboard
  - Added mock AI interpretation service (placeholder for future API integration)
  - Integrated responsive design across all tarot components

## Next Steps
1. **Plan for Milestone 3 Implementation**
   - Design journaling feature structure and component hierarchy
   - Plan integration between tarot readings and journal entries
   - Create data models for journal entries
   - Design UI for journal creation and editing

2. **Enhance AI Interpretation Feature**
   - Research and select AI provider for production
   - Implement secure API integration
   - Fine-tune prompts for better tarot interpretations

3. **Technical Improvements**
   - Refactor SCSS to address deprecation warnings
   - Update imports to use modern @use and @forward syntax
   - Replace deprecated color functions with modern alternatives
   - Add testing for tarot reading components

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Supabase for authentication and database instead of Clerk
- Feature-based code organization maintains clear separation of concerns
- Redux Toolkit async thunks for authentication actions
- Protected routes implementation with loading states
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

### Implementation Priorities
- Journaling feature implementation (Milestone 3)
- AI interpretation service enhancement with real API integration
- Refactoring SCSS to address deprecation warnings
- Testing components for reliability and performance
- Improving integration between tarot readings and user dashboard

### Pending Decisions
- Selection of specific AI API provider for production (options include OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Hugging Face models)
- Implementation approach for AI integration (direct API, backend proxy, or Supabase Edge Functions)
- Database schema design for journal entries
- Integration approach between readings and journal entries
- User experience flow for combined reading and journaling features

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Project Patterns
- Early returns for error handling in React components
- Feature-focused organization of code
- Component-based architecture with clear hierarchy
- Redux state slices per feature
- Custom hooks for reusable logic (auth state, form handling)

### Coding Preferences
- PascalCase for React components
- camelCase for variables and functions
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Event handler functions prefixed with "handle"
- Organize components by feature in dedicated directories

### UI/UX Considerations
- Intuitive, engaging, and accessible interface
- Thoughtful and reflective design that encourages mindfulness
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Seamless integration between tarot readings and journaling
- Privacy-focused design with secure user data handling
- Consistent use of dark themes with gradient accents across sections
- Card-based UI components with hover effects and visual hierarchy

## Learnings & Project Insights
Insights from Milestone 1 and 2 implementations include:

- The Supabase authentication integration provides a robust foundation for the application
- Feature-based organization makes it easier to locate and update related code
- Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk simplifies handling async operations like authentication
- Protected routes with proper loading states improve user experience
- Responsive design from the start ensures consistent experience across devices
- Clear component hierarchy improves maintainability and understanding
- SCSS deprecation warnings need to be addressed for future-proofing

New insights from Milestone 2:
- Breaking down complex workflows into discrete steps improves user experience
- React's component model works well for card-based interfaces with reusable elements
- Redux state management is valuable for multi-step processes like tarot readings
- Animation can significantly enhance the mystical experience of tarot card interaction
- Mock services provide a good way to develop UI without waiting for backend implementation
- Tailwind CSS utility classes speed up consistent UI development across components

The project now has both a solid foundation with authentication and the core tarot reading functionality implemented. This puts us in a strong position to implement the journaling features and enhance the overall application in Milestone 3.

This active context document will be regularly updated as the project evolves, with particular attention to current focus, recent changes, and next steps to ensure continuity between development sessions.
