# Active Context: TarotLyfe

## Current Focus
The project has completed both Milestone 1 and Milestone 2 implementation phases. With Milestone 1, we successfully implemented authentication with Supabase, responsive navigation, landing page, and dashboard placeholder. With Milestone 2, we've implemented the complete Tarot Reading Module and AI Interpretation Engine.

We have made significant progress on Milestone 3, having completed Phase 1 (Database Setup), Phase 2 (Service Layer), Phase 3 (Journal Entry Core), and Phase 4 (Journal Management). We've created the database schema for journals, journal tags, and tag mappings with appropriate Row-Level Security policies, extended the Supabase service layer with comprehensive journal and tag management functions, implemented the Redux state management for the journaling feature, and added rich text editing, enhanced mood selection, and advanced filtering and search for journal entries. We are now ready to proceed with Phase 5 (Dashboard Integration) to continue improving the journaling functionality.

   - Replace deprecated color functions with modern alternatives
   - Add testing for tarot reading components

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Implemented Redux slice for journaling with proper state structure and async thunks
- Designed comprehensive Supabase service for journal and tag management
- Created database schema with appropriate relationships and RLS policies
- Using Supabase for authentication and database instead of Clerk
- Feature-based code organization maintains clear separation of concerns
- Redux Toolkit async thunks for authentication actions
- Protected routes implementation with loading states
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

### Implementation Priorities
- Journaling feature implementation (Milestone 3)
- AI interpretation service enhancement with real API integration
- Refactoring SCSS to address deprecation warnings
- Testing components for reliability and performance
- Improving integration between tarot readings and user dashboard

### Pending Decisions
- Selection of specific AI API provider for production (options include OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Hugging Face models)
- Implementation approach for AI integration (direct API, backend proxy, or Supabase Edge Functions)
- Design of dashboard statistics and activity visualizations
- Mobile layout optimizations for the journal interface

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Project Patterns
- Early returns for error handling in React components
- Feature-focused organization of code
- Component-based architecture with clear hierarchy
- Redux state slices per feature
- Custom hooks for reusable logic (auth state, form handling)

### Coding Preferences
- PascalCase for React components
- camelCase for variables and functions
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Event handler functions prefixed with "handle"
- Organize components by feature in dedicated directories

### UI/UX Considerations
- Intuitive, engaging, and accessible interface
- Thoughtful and reflective design that encourages mindfulness
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Seamless integration between tarot readings and journaling
- Privacy-focused design with secure user data handling
- Consistent use of dark themes with gradient accents across sections
- Card-based UI components with hover effects and visual hierarchy

## Learnings & Project Insights
Insights from Milestone 1, 2, and the beginning of Milestone 3 implementations include:

- The Supabase authentication integration provides a robust foundation for the application
- Feature-based organization makes it easier to locate and update related code
- Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk simplifies handling async operations like authentication
- Protected routes with proper loading states improve user experience
- Responsive design from the start ensures consistent experience across devices
- Clear component hierarchy improves maintainability and understanding
- SCSS deprecation warnings need to be addressed for future-proofing

New insights from Milestone 2:
- Breaking down complex workflows into discrete steps improves user experience
- React's component model works well for card-based interfaces with reusable elements
- Redux state management is valuable for multi-step processes like tarot readings
- Animation can significantly enhance the mystical experience of tarot card interaction
- Tailwind CSS utility classes speed up consistent UI development across components

Additional insights from completing all phases of Milestone 2:
- Proper database schema design with Row-Level Security is crucial for user data privacy
- Caching strategies can significantly improve performance for API-dependent features
- Context-aware AI responses provide more meaningful and personalized experiences
- Breaking reading history into filterable, paginated views improves usability as data grows
- Component reuse between main features and dashboard widgets creates consistency
- Structured JSON responses from interpretation services allow for flexible UI rendering

New insights from Milestone 3 Phase 3:
- Rich text editing provides a better journaling experience compared to plain text
- Visual mood selectors with emojis create a more intuitive and engaging user experience
- Proper handling of HTML content in previews requires careful sanitization
- Tailwind Typography plugin greatly simplifies styling for rich text content
- Consistent visual language for mood indicators helps unify the UI across components

Previous insights from Milestone 3 Phase 1 & 2:
- Creating junction tables for many-to-many relationships (journal entries to tags) provides flexibility
- Designing database tables with appropriate foreign key relationships ensures data integrity
- Implementing Row-Level Security at the database level is essential for multi-user applications
- Using complex query filters in Supabase requires proper indexing for performance
- Handling nested relationships (like journal entries -> tags) requires careful state management

The project now has both a solid foundation with authentication, the core tarot reading functionality, and the beginning of the journaling feature. The database schema and service layer for journaling are in place, which provides a strong foundation for implementing the user interface components in the upcoming phases.

This active context document will be regularly updated as the project evolves, with particular attention to current focus, recent changes, and next steps to ensure continuity between development sessions.
