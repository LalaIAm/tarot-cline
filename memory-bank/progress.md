## Current Status
Milestone 2 has been successfully implemented. The application now has a fully functional tarot reading feature that includes a tarot card database, deck management, spread selection, shuffle animation, and an AI interpretation system. The tarot reading workflow guides users from setting their intention through selecting a spread, shuffling the deck, drawing cards, and receiving their interpretation.

The Redux state management system for tarot readings has been implemented, allowing for future enhancements like saving readings to the database and connecting them with the journaling feature in Milestone 3. The UI components provide an engaging, intuitive experience with responsive design for all device sizes.

## Completed Setup Tasks
- âœ… Initialized React project with Vite
- âœ… Set up Redux Toolkit for state management 
- âœ… Configured React Router for navigation
- âœ… Established SCSS styling structure with variables and components
- âœ… Created feature-based folder organization
- âœ… Set up environment variables
- âœ… Added ESLint for code quality
- âœ… Created basic layouts and components
- âœ… Set up project documentation with README
- âœ… Created authentication state slice with Redux

## Milestone 1 Implementation (Completed)
- âœ… Integrated Supabase for authentication and database
- âœ… Created authentication components (login, signup, password reset)
- âœ… Added protected routes for authenticated users
- âœ… Implemented responsive navigation and footer
- âœ… Created landing page with feature highlights and pricing section
- âœ… Established comprehensive style guide for consistent design patterns
- âœ… Developed dashboard placeholder page
- âœ… Set up environment variables for Supabase

## Milestone 2 Implementation (Completed)
- âœ… Created comprehensive tarot card data structure with all 78 cards
- âœ… Built TarotDeck component for managing and interacting with cards
- âœ… Implemented SpreadSelector with multiple spread layouts (Single Card, Three-Card, Celtic Cross, etc.)
- âœ… Developed ShuffleAnimation component for interactive card shuffling
- âœ… Created UserIntent component for capturing reading questions
- âœ… Built ReadingInterpretation component for displaying results
- âœ… Implemented Redux state management for tarot reading flow
- âœ… Connected tarot reading feature with navigation and dashboard
- âœ… Integrated responsive design across all tarot components

### AI Integration (Phase 3) - Completed
- âœ… Created comprehensive interpretationService with advanced prompt engineering
- âœ… Implemented response caching to optimize performance and reduce API calls
- âœ… Built a sophisticated mock AI implementation with theme detection and context-aware responses

### Database Persistence (Phase 5) - Completed
- âœ… Added SQL migration scripts for creating reading tables with Row-Level Security policies
- âœ… Extended supabaseService with reading management functions (save, load, delete)
- âœ… Updated Redux state management to connect with actual database operations

### Testing & Refinement (Phase 6) - Completed
- âœ… Implemented ReadingHistory component with filtering, pagination, and card previews
- âœ… Created RecentReadingsWidget for Dashboard integration
- âœ… Added routes for browsing reading history and viewing saved readings
- âœ… Connected all components with Redux state management

## Known Issues & Risks
- SCSS deprecation warnings (using @import and global color functions)
- Potential risks include:
  - Integration complexity with AI interpretation services
  - Ensuring proper security for personal journal entries
  - Maintaining performance with complex tarot animations
  - Balancing feature scope with development timeline

## Recent Decisions & Changes
- Implemented authentication with Supabase instead of Clerk as initially indicated in package.json
- Created a branching strategy with feature branches (milestone-1-implementation, milestone-2-implementation)
- Established authentication flow with Supabase
- Designed landing page with feature highlights
- Created responsive navigation with mobile support
- Set up protected routes for authenticated content
- Implemented full tarot reading workflow from user intent to interpretation
- Designed modular components for each step of the reading process
- Set up Redux state management for tarot reading feature
- Implemented comprehensive AI interpretation service with theme detection
- Created database schema with RLS policies for secure reading storage
- Added reading history with filtering and pagination capabilities
- Integrated reading history with dashboard for quick access

## Next Actions
1. Begin planning for Milestone 3 implementation:
   - Design the journaling feature structure and component hierarchy
   - Plan integration between tarot readings and journal entries
   - Create data models for journal entries
   - Design UI for journal creation and editing
2. Enhance AI interpretation functionality for production:
   - Research and select real AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, etc.)
   - Setup secure API keys management
   - Fine-tune prompts for more accurate tarot interpretations
3. Refactor SCSS to address deprecation warnings
4. Expand test coverage for tarot reading components

This progress document will be continually updated as development progresses to maintain a clear record of project status and evolution.
