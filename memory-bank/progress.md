## Current Status

We have made substantial progress on Milestone 3, having completed Phases 1-6 and now working on Phase 7 (Testing & Refinement). We have set up Cypress for end-to-end testing and implemented comprehensive test suites for all aspects of the journaling feature:

- Core functionality tests (creating, editing, viewing, and deleting journals)
- Filtering and search tests (tag filtering, mood selection, date ranges, and keyword search)
- Reading-journal connection tests (creating entries from readings, visual indicators, navigation)
- Dashboard integration tests (widgets, statistics, quick actions)
- Authentication tests (login, logout, form validation)

These tests help ensure that all components work well together and provide a smooth user experience. We are now focusing on running these tests, identifying any issues, and fixing bugs or edge cases discovered during testing.

The application now has:
- End-to-end test coverage for all journaling features
- Custom testing commands for authentication and data management
- Test fixtures with sample data
- Test suite organization by feature area
- NPM scripts for running specific test categories

All the core journaling functionality is now in place and being thoroughly tested:
- Rich text journal entries with mood selection and tagging
- Advanced filtering, search, and sorting capabilities
- Reading-journal connection with bidirectional navigation
- Dashboard integration with activity statistics and widgets
- Quick action buttons for creating new entries
