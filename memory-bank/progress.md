## Current Status
Milestone 1 has been successfully implemented. The application now has authentication with Supabase, a responsive navigation system, a landing page, and a dashboard placeholder for authenticated users. All components for authentication flow have been built, including login, signup, password reset, and email confirmation.

We have completed the detailed planning for Milestone 2, with a comprehensive implementation plan in place. This plan includes component specifications, technical sequence, database schema design, and AI integration options. The foundation for the entire application is now solid and ready for the implementation of core features in Milestone 2.

## Completed Setup Tasks
- âœ… Initialized React project with Vite
- âœ… Set up Redux Toolkit for state management 
- âœ… Configured React Router for navigation
- âœ… Established SCSS styling structure with variables and components
- âœ… Created feature-based folder organization
- âœ… Set up environment variables
- âœ… Added ESLint for code quality
- âœ… Created basic layouts and components
- âœ… Set up project documentation with README
- âœ… Created authentication state slice with Redux

## Milestone 1 Implementation (Completed)
- âœ… Integrated Supabase for authentication and database
- âœ… Created authentication components (login, signup, password reset)
- âœ… Added protected routes for authenticated users
- âœ… Implemented responsive navigation and footer
- âœ… Created landing page with feature highlights and pricing section
- âœ… Established comprehensive style guide for consistent design patterns
- âœ… Developed dashboard placeholder page
- âœ… Set up environment variables for Supabase

## Known Issues & Risks
- SCSS deprecation warnings (using @import and global color functions)
- Potential risks include:
  - Integration complexity with AI interpretation services
  - Ensuring proper security for personal journal entries
  - Maintaining performance with complex tarot animations
  - Balancing feature scope with development timeline

## Recent Decisions & Changes
- Implemented authentication with Supabase instead of Clerk as initially indicated in package.json
- Created a branching strategy with feature branches (milestone-1-implementation)
- Established authentication flow with Supabase
- Designed landing page with feature highlights
- Created responsive navigation with mobile support
- Set up protected routes for authenticated content
- Developed comprehensive Milestone 2 implementation plan
- Defined Tarot Reading feature structure and components
- Outlined AI integration options for tarot interpretations

## Next Actions
1. Begin implementation of Milestone 2 features:
   - Create new Git branch for Milestone 2 implementation
   - Implement tarot card data structure (tarotData.js)
   - Enhance TarotCard component with flip animations
   - Develop TarotDeck management component
   - Implement spread selection interface
2. Refactor SCSS to address deprecation warnings
3. Create tarot reading Redux slice (tarotReadingSlice.js)
4. Research and select AI provider for tarot interpretations

This progress document will be continually updated as development progresses to maintain a clear record of project status and evolution.
