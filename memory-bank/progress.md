   - [ ] AI integration for readings
   - [ ] Reading display and interpretation UI

3. **Milestone 3: Journaling Feature and User Dashboard**
   - [ ] Journal entry creation and editing
   - [ ] Tagging and categorization system
   - [ ] Search functionality
   - [ ] Dashboard integration with readings and journal entries

4. **Milestone 4: Account Management and Security Enhancements**
   - [ ] Profile editing functionality
   - [ ] Password management
   - [ ] Account recovery options
   - [ ] Preferences and settings

5. **Milestone 5: Testing, Launch Preparation, and Post-Launch Support**
   - [ ] Unit testing suite
   - [ ] Integration testing
   - [ ] End-to-end testing
   - [ ] CI/CD pipeline
   - [ ] Deployment preparation

## Current Status
The project has completed the initialization phase. We have set up the React project repository with Vite, established the proper folder structure, and configured all essential dependencies according to the architectural decisions documented in the memory bank. The application now has a basic structure ready for feature implementation.

## Completed Setup Tasks
- âœ… Initialized React project with Vite
- âœ… Set up Redux Toolkit for state management 
- âœ… Configured React Router for navigation
- âœ… Established SCSS styling structure with variables and components
- âœ… Created feature-based folder organization
- âœ… Set up environment variables
- âœ… Added ESLint for code quality
- âœ… Created basic layouts and components
- âœ… Set up project documentation with README
- âœ… Created authentication state slice with Redux

## Known Issues & Risks
- SCSS deprecation warnings (using @import and global color functions)
- Potential risks include:
  - Integration complexity with AI interpretation services
  - Ensuring proper security for personal journal entries
  - Maintaining performance with complex tarot animations
  - Balancing feature scope with development timeline

## Recent Decisions & Changes
- Established memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Defined feature-based code organization approach
- Committed to React with Redux Toolkit for frontend
- Selected Node.js and PostgreSQL for backend technology
- Decided to use Supabase for authentication and database
- Created basic project structure with all required dependencies
- Implemented SCSS with a component-based approach
- Created detailed implementation plan for Milestone 1

## Next Actions
1. Begin implementation of Milestone 1 features according to the plan:
   - Create landing page design and components
   - Implement authentication with Supabase
   - Set up Supabase database with Row Level Security
   - Set up core navigation and protected routes
2. Refactor SCSS to address deprecation warnings
3. Create shared UI components for consistent design

This progress document will be continually updated as development progresses to maintain a clear record of project status and evolution.
