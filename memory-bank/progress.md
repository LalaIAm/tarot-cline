## Current Status
The project is currently in the initialization phase. Memory bank documentation has been established to provide a comprehensive overview of the project goals, architecture, and implementation plan. The next step is to set up the actual project structure and begin implementation of Milestone 1 features.

## Known Issues & Risks
- No active development issues at this stage as implementation has not begun
- Potential risks include:
  - Integration complexity with AI interpretation services
  - Ensuring proper security for personal journal entries
  - Maintaining performance with complex tarot animations
  - Balancing feature scope with development timeline

## Recent Decisions & Changes
- Established memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Defined feature-based code organization approach
- Committed to React with Redux Toolkit for frontend
- Selected Node.js and PostgreSQL for backend technology

## Next Actions
1. Initialize React project repository
2. Set up folder structure following the defined patterns
3. Configure essential dependencies
4. Implement basic UI component library
5. Begin landing page development

This progress document will be continually updated as development progresses to maintain a clear record of project status and evolution.
