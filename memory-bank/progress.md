## Current Status

We have made substantial progress on Milestone 3. Phases 1 (Database Setup), 2 (Service Layer), and 3 (Journal Entry Core) have been successfully completed. 

The application now has:
- Database tables for journal entries, tags, and tag mappings with appropriate Row-Level Security policies
- A comprehensive service layer with journal and tag management functions
- Redux state management with actions, reducers, and selectors for the journaling feature
- A rich text editor implementation using TipTap for journal content
- A visual mood selector with emoji support and color coding
- Enhanced journal entry display components that properly render rich text
- Updated list views that properly handle HTML content in previews

We have created a solid foundation for the journaling feature, which now has a fully functional entry creation form with rich text and mood selection capabilities. We are now preparing to work on Phase 4 (Journal Management) to implement more sophisticated filtering and search functionality.

Milestone 2 was previously completed with a fully functional tarot reading feature, including tarot card database, deck management, spread selection, shuffle animation, and an AI interpretation system.

## Known Issues & Risks

- SCSS deprecation warnings (using @import and global color functions)
- Potential risks include:
  - Integration complexity with AI interpretation services
  - Ensuring proper security for personal journal entries
  - Maintaining performance with complex tarot animations
  - Balancing feature scope with development timeline

## Recent Decisions & Changes

- Implemented authentication with Supabase instead of Clerk as initially indicated in package.json
- Created a branching strategy with feature branches (milestone-1-implementation, milestone-2-implementation)
- Established authentication flow with Supabase
- Designed landing page with feature highlights
- Created responsive navigation with mobile support
- Set up protected routes for authenticated content
- Implemented full tarot reading workflow from user intent to interpretation
- Designed modular components for each step of the reading process
- Set up Redux state management for tarot reading feature
- Implemented comprehensive AI interpretation service with theme detection
- Created database schema with RLS policies for secure reading storage
- Added reading history with filtering and pagination capabilities
- Integrated reading history with dashboard for quick access
- Completed planning for Milestone 3 with detailed implementation plan

## Next Actions

1. Continue implementing Milestone 3:

   - Complete Phase 2 (Service Layer): Finalize service functions for tagging and filtering
   - Start Phase 3 (Journal Entry Core): Implement form components with rich text editing
   - Implement journal entry form with mood selection and tag input

2. Enhance AI interpretation functionality for production:

   - Research and select real AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, etc.)
   - Setup secure API keys management
   - Fine-tune prompts for more accurate tarot interpretations

3. Refactor SCSS to address deprecation warnings
4. Expand test coverage for tarot reading components

This progress document will be continually updated as development progresses to maintain a clear record of project status and evolution.
