## How to Use These Files

These files contain the development plan and implementation guidelines for your project. You can use them with AI coding assistants to help build your project:

1. **Cursor Rules**: Implementation guidelines and coding standards
2. **Predev Plan**: Project architecture and development roadmap
3. **README**: This file with usage instructions

### Using with AI Assistants

You can feed these documents to AI coding assistants like:
- Cursor
- Claude Code
- Cline
- Windsurf
- Other AI Coding Agents

Simply ask the AI to "Execute the plan to generate the full project based on these documents" and provide both the cursor rules and predev plan files.

The AI will help you implement the project according to the specifications and architecture outlined in these documents.
